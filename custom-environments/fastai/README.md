# `fast.ai` Custom Environment

This folder contains a example yml file to create a custom SageMaker Studio Lab environment for `fast.ai`. This is a default fastai environment with all dependencies including PyTorch and other packages as well as all example datasets. This environment contains everything you need to complete the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/).

Since this environment requires significant space, you may choose to install `fast.ai` without dependencies as described in the custom dependencies section [here](https://fastai1.fast.ai/install.html#custom-dependencies).
